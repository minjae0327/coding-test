Wait, maybe I need to check the exact numbers again. The table says for \"가\" (A), the lodging is $35 (daily) and $220 (nightly). But the professor is staying for 4 days. Wait, but the question is about lodging expenses. \n",

So, assuming that they stay for 4 nights, the total lodging cost would be 4 times $220. But wait, the table says for \"가\" (A), the lodging is $35 per day and $220 per night.
